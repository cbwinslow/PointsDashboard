The app uses the Python pybaseball package to pull data that was done in a previous project.

All_Stats.csv file was pulled from my pybaseball database project:

https://github.com/ttaylor14/pybaseball-database



This data was then cleaned to only include the past 20 years.


and Active Link of the current app can be found here:

Future additions include:

[ ] - Marcel Projection Models

[ ] - Player Regression Graphing

[ ] - Player Position appearances

[ ] - player value above replacement based on league and team size
